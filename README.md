<h1>Depth Crawler</h1>
<p>is a text based, dungeon crawler, action RPG with a simple looting and combat system as well as a fully realised story reliant on NPC dialogue and a quest system. This was a solo project developped over the span of two weeks in parallel 
with another project <a href="#">Death Delt Hand</a>. This game relies heavily on random procedural generation which allows for a different experience each and every playthrough. This randomness effects the map layout, enemy spawns, loot chances as well as other factors.</p>
<br>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The main gameplay loop revolves around exploring the dungeon in order to find support items, complete quests and eventually reach the ending. To do this, the player is given access to Primary Actions. </p>
<p>Primary Actions can be broken down into 4 main mechanics which come in the form of executeable actions that the player can choose between. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Leave Room</p></li>
  <li><p>Surprise Attack</p></li>
  <li><p>Search for Valuables</p></li>
  <li><p>Check Inventory</p></li>
</ul>
